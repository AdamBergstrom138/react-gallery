# React Gallery

React Gallery is an app to display images using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.  The app displays a "front" and "back" of an image when clicked, with a description on the backside of the image. There is also a like button with a counter displayed under each image.

## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

The challenge was getting the component GalleryItem to work with GalleyList to render each item to the DOM.  The other challenge was setting up CSS files to render the way I intended.
