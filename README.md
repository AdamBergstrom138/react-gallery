# React Gallery

React Gallery is an app to display images using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.  The app will display a "front" and "back" of an image when clicked.  A description is on the backside of the image. There is also a like button with a counter displayed under each image.

## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

It was a challenge getting the component GalleryItem to work with GalleyList to render each item to the DOM.  It was also challenging setting up CSS files to render the way I intended.
